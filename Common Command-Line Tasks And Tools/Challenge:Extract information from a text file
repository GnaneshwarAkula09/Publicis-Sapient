Challeneg: Parse information from a text file:
1.Extract log.tar.gz
2.Look for unauthroized connection attempts
3.Extract the usernames an attacker tried to use
4.Create a file containing these names(and make it organized)
5.Use tools you've learned about to explore and process the log

Solution:
1.tar -xvf log.tar.gz
2.less auth.log
3.Extract usernames
4.cat auth.loh | grep "input_userauth_request"
  cat auth.loh | grep "input_userauth_request" awk '{print $9}'
5.cat auth.loh | grep "input_userauth_request" awk '{print $9}' | sort -u >users.txt
