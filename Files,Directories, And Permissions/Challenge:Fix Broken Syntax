FIX BROKEN SYNTAX:Correct these commands and describe the errors in each:
-->cd ~/home/gyan
-->LS /home
-->mv ~/log.tar.gz home gyan
-->chown ~/log.tar.gz

SOLUTION:
1.cd ~/home/gyan -> cd ~ (or cd/home/gyan) [To move to home directory we can use cd ~ or directly use cd/home/gyan]
2.LS /home -> ls /home [LS command is captalized all commands need to be in lowercase because command names are case sensitive]
3.mv ~/log.tar.gz home gyan ->  mv ~/log.tar.gz /home/gyan [move commands take ony two arguments but we are taking three,so we need to convert last two arguments into path]
4.chown ~/log.tar.gz -> chown 644 ~/log.tar.gz [ocatal representation need to be present to apply permission of the file]
